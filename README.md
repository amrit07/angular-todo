## steps to run the app
For now, auto compilation functionality for the solution is not activated. Thus, for every changes on javascript files, we need to compile the solution with "npm run build" command on the terminal to get update or reflect changes on the app.

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. node server
4. browse http://localhost:8080/
